About VAMDC
-------------

The Virtual Atomic and Molecular Data Center is a EU FP7 research 
infrastructure project. A comprehensive documentation about the project,
standards and related software can be found on the official webpage http://vamdc.eu/.


VAMDC nodes
-------------

A "node" within VAMDC is a data service that offers its data using the
standards and protocols defined by the VAMDC. They are web services with a
simple API, the specification of which can be found in the documentation for
the VAMDC standards: http://vamdc.org/documents/standards/ 

The scope of this document is to serve as documentation for the 
reference implementation of such a service. The goal of this 
implementation is to serve as publishing tools for new data services, 
i.e. it is meant to be easily deployed at multiple nodes.
